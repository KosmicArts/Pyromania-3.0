# Pyromania-2.0
An updated redesigned version of the original Pyromania.
=============================================================
Process:

- First wrote the HTML, then set up CSS and SASS using 7-1 architecture.
- Learned to use position: relative/absolute to position elements, especially in the center of the page
- Created hero section button. Used inline-block and text-align: center to position at the center of the hero section.
- Created the content of section_info.
- Learned to use some CSS Grid to structure section_info.
- Created section_benefits and refactored some variable names and better organized styles into seperate files.
